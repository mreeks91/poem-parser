# poem-parser
Parsing poem texts in csvs for sampling.

## To run on a new poem:
Copy the poem text into a text file named `POEM_NAME.txt` in the same directory as `poem_parser.py`. Change the `POEM_NAME` variable at the top of `poem_parser.py` to match your new poem file. Run `python poem_parser.py` from the command line to create a corresponding parsed poem csv.
