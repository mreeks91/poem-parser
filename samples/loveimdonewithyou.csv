stanza,line,line-within-stanza
0,1,You ever wake up with your footie PJs warming
0,2,your neck like a noose? Ever upchuck
0,3,after a home-cooked meal? Or notice
0,4,how the blood on the bottoms of your feet
0,5,"just won’t seem to go away? Love, it used to be"
0,6,you could retire your toothbrush for like two or three days and still
0,7,I’d push my downy face into your neck. Used to be
0,8,I hung on your every word. (Sing! you’d say: and I was a bird.
0,9,"Freedom! you’d say: and I never really knew what that meant,"
0,10,but liked the way it rang like a rusty bell.) Used to be. But now
0,11,I can tell you your breath stinks and you’re full of shit.
0,12,You have more lies about yourself than bodies
0,13,beneath your bed. Rooting
0,14,"for the underdog. Team player. Hook,"
0,15,"line and sinker. Love, you helped design the brick"
0,16,that built the walls around the castle
0,17,in the basement of which is a vault
0,18,inside of which is another vault
0,19,inside of which . . . you get my point. Your tongue
0,20,is made of honey but flicks like a snake’s. Voice
0,21,like a bird but everyone’s ears are bleeding.
0,22,From the inside your house shines
0,23,"and shines, but from outside you can see"
0,24,it’s built from bones. From out here it looks
0,25,"like a graveyard, and the garden’s"
0,26,"all ash. And besides,"
0,27,your breath stinks. We’re through.
